notes: |
  This migration plan focuses on transitioning from quantum-vulnerable 
  public-key cryptography (RSA, ECC, DH) to post-quantum alternatives
  (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+). Symmetric cryptography (AES-256) 
  remains secure with larger key sizes. The hybrid approach in Phase 2
  ensures security during the transition period.
